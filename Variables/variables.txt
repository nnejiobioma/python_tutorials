WHAT IS VARIABLE IN PYTHON:

    Variables in Python are named containers that store data values during program execution.
    They allow you to assign meaningful names to data, making your code more readable, maintainable,
    and efficient.

HOW ARE VARIABLES CREATED

WHAT ARE VALUABLE RULES:

    1. Must start with a letter or underscore (_).
    2. Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but the first character cannot be a number.
    3. Case-sensitive (e.g., name is different from Name).
    4. Choose descriptive names to reflect the data they hold.

ASSINMENT:
    Use the = operator to assign a value to a variable.
    Example: age = 30 creates a variable age and stores the value 30 in it.

DATA TYPES:
    Variables can hold different types of data:
    - Numbers (integers, floats)
    - Strings (text)
    - Booleans (True or False)
    - Lists (ordered collections of items)
    - Tuples (immutable ordered collections)
    - Dictionaries (collections of key-value pairs)
    - Others (custom classes, objects)

SCOPE:
    - Variables have a scope, which determines where they are accessible.
    - Local variables (created within functions) are accessible only within that function.
    - Global variables (created outside functions) are accessible from anywhere in the program.
    - Use local variables whenever possible to prevent unintended side effects from modifying global variables.

Best practices:

    - Use meaningful variable names.
    - Declare variables before using them (helps with readability and potential typos).
    - Choose appropriate data types to avoid casting (converting) values unnecessarily.
    - Use local variables where possible.
    - Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., using lowercase with underscores for variable names).
