What are python data types?

What are built-in data type?
 In python, there are built in data types which are:
    1. Numeric:
            Represents numbers in Python.

            Includes:

            Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).
            Floats: Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, 2.718).
            Complex numbers: Numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 3+2j).
            Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

            Used for calculations, representing quantities, measurements, etc.

    2. Sequence Type:
            Ordered collection of items accessed by index.

            Examples:

            List: Mutable, can change contents (e.g., [1, "hello", 3.5]).
            Tuple: Immutable, cannot change contents (e.g., (10, "world", True)).
            String: Immutable sequence of characters (e.g., "Python is fun!").
            Operations: Indexing, slicing, concatenation, membership checking, iteration.

            Used for storing collections of data in a specific order.

    3. Boolean:

            1. Represents logical truth values.
            2. Values: True or False.
            3. Used for making decisions in control flow statements like if and while.

    4. set:

            1. Unordered collection of unique elements.
            2. Elements cannot be duplicates.
            3. Mutable, can add or remove elements.
            4. Operations: Membership checking, union, intersection, difference.
            5. Used for representing unique items, checking if an element exists, combining or comparing sets.

    5. Dictionary:

            1. Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
            2. Keys are unique and immutable (e.g., strings, integers).
            3. Values can be any data type.
            4. Mutable, can change key-value pairs.
            5. Operations: Accessing elements by key, adding or modifying key-value pairs, checking keys or values.
            6. Used for storing data associated with unique keys, organizing information in key-value pairs.

To check which data type is been used, use print(type())
    Example:
        f = {1,2,3,4}
            print (type(f))

            output <class 'set'>
