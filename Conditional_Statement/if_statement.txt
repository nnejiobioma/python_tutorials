Assignment:
1. Word Guessing Game:

The computer thinks of a random word from a predefined list.
The player has a certain number of attempts to guess the word.
After each guess, the program provides feedback like "correct," "incorrect," "letter is in the word but not in the right position," or "letter is not in the word."
The player wins if they guess the word correctly within the allowed attempts.
2. Rock-Paper-Scissors:

The computer randomly chooses between rock, paper, and scissors.
The player chooses their hand sign (rock, paper, or scissors).
The program compares the choices and declares the winner based on the classic rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock).
3. Hangman:

The computer chooses a random word from a predefined list.
The player guesses letters one by one.
If the letter is in the word, it gets revealed in the correct positions.
If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman gets drawn (e.g., head, body, limbs).
The player loses if the hangman is complete before they guess the entire word.
The player wins if they guess all the letters correctly before the hangman is complete.
4. Number Mystery:

The computer generates a random number within a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
The player has to guess the number by providing higher or lower guesses.
After each guess, the program tells the player if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The player wins if they guess the number correctly within a certain number of attempts.
5. Mad Libs:

The program prompts the player for different words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).
It then inserts these words into a pre-written story template, creating a silly or humorous outcome.
These are just a few examples, and you can come up with many other variations based on different themes and mechanics. Remember to keep the rules simple and the gameplay engaging for a fun and interactive experience.
